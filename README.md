 These codes serves as a supplementary tool for theoretical analysis of 
 - "Fast, Slow and Opportunistic Fluid Antenna Multiple Access (FAMA) under Nakagami-m fading channels and
 applications to cell-Free networks", 
 

The codes calculate and simulate theoretical OP for FAMA under Nakagami-m fading channels in
 different configurations:
 - systems: slow-FAMA, fast-FAMA, cell-free with MRT precoding for fast and
 slow FAMA;
 - correlation: constant correlation, spatial-block correlation;
 - categories of interference: interference-limited, noise-limited 
 (no interference), combined interference and noise;
 - methods: direct numerical integration, Gauss-Laguerre quadrature
 approximation (faster computation).
